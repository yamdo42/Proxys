# Proxys.io Promo Codes and Latest Reliable Proxy Service Deals for 2026

## Proxys.io Introduction

Picture this: you're sitting there, needing to run multiple accounts, scrape some data, or just stay anonymous online—and suddenly every provider sounds the same. "Fast proxies!" "Secure connections!" Yeah, we've heard it all before.

But here's where Proxys.io actually catches your attention. They've been around since 2016, which in internet years means they've survived the chaos, the competition, and probably a few tech disasters along the way. They're not some flashy newcomer making wild promises—they're the quiet achiever that just... works.

What makes them different? Well, they've got proxies from more than 240 countries. Not just the usual suspects like the US and UK, but places you probably forgot existed. Need a proxy from Bangladesh? They've got it. Jordan? Yep. Montenegro? Sure, why not.

The service runs on autopilot. You pay, and boom—proxies appear in your account immediately. No waiting around for some support person to manually activate things. They support both HTTP(S) and SOCKS5 protocols, which basically means whether you're a developer, a marketer, or just someone who wants to browse without leaving digital footprints everywhere, they've got you covered.

The pricing starts at a genuinely accessible 13 cents per month for IPv6 proxies. Not 13 cents per day—per month. That's less than the cost of a single coffee, and it won't give you the jitters.

Their support team actually responds. Not in "we'll get back to you in 2-3 business days" style, but usually within minutes. That's the kind of thing you don't appreciate until you've been left hanging by other providers at 2 AM when something breaks.

What do they offer? Pretty much everything:

- **Individual IPv4 proxies** - The classic choice that works with basically everything on the web
- **Shared IPv4 proxies** - Budget-friendly option if you don't mind sharing with two other users
- **Residential IPv4 proxies** - The premium stuff for when you need to look like a regular home user
- **IPv6 proxies** - The future of the internet, available today at pocket-change prices
- **Mobile proxies** - Real mobile network IPs for the highest level of trust
- **Dynamic proxies** - For when you need your IP to rotate automatically

They also offer over 50 payment methods, including crypto, which means whether you're paying with a credit card, Bitcoin, or even Alipay, they're not going to make you jump through hoops.

There's a 24-hour money-back guarantee too. If the proxies don't work for your use case, you can get your money back. No drama, no endless email chains—just a straightforward refund policy.

The company operates under ONLINE CONNECT LTD in London, and they've built a reputation for stability rather than hype. When other providers were busy with fancy marketing, Proxys.io was busy making sure their servers actually worked.

Are they perfect? Probably not. But they're honest about what they offer, their pricing is transparent, and they've been doing this long enough to know what actually matters to users. Sometimes that's more valuable than a website full of promises.

## Proxys.io Reviews

So what do actual users think? Let's cut through the marketing speak and look at real feedback from people who've actually used the service.

**The Good Stuff:**

Most users consistently praise a few key areas. The support team gets frequent mentions—people report getting responses within minutes, not days. When you're dealing with technical issues at odd hours, that kind of responsiveness isn't just nice, it's essential.

Performance is another strong point. Users running tests across different regions report solid uptime (consistently above 99%), stable speeds, and minimal packet loss. For tasks like web scraping, account management, or SEO monitoring, the proxies apparently just work without constant babysitting.

The pricing earns positive feedback too. Multiple reviewers mention that Proxys.io offers better value compared to competitors, particularly for bulk purchases. The volume discounts are real, not just marketing fluff.

The interface gets approval for being clean and functional rather than confusing. Even users who aren't particularly tech-savvy report being able to set up and manage their proxies without pulling their hair out.

**The Not-So-Good:**

Some users mention occasional maintenance periods where proxies become temporarily unavailable, though resolution times are usually under 24 hours. It's worth noting that this seems to happen more with certain geographic locations than others.

The shared IPv4 proxies come with expected limitations—since you're sharing with two other users, there's less control and occasional performance variability. That's the trade-off for the cheaper price, and Proxys.io is upfront about this.

A few reviews mention that the refund policy, while present, has specific terms. For shared proxies in particular, the replacement/refund policy is more restrictive due to the nature of the service. Reading the terms before purchasing is genuinely important here.

There are scattered complaints about certain proxies having low trust scores or being flagged by some websites. However, this is somewhat par for the course in the proxy industry—no provider has 100% clean IPs all the time.

**Overall Sentiment:**

The general consensus seems to be that Proxys.io is a solid, dependable choice rather than a flashy but unreliable one. Users appreciate the straightforward approach, transparent pricing, and responsive support. It's not positioned as the cheapest option on the market, but users generally feel they're getting fair value for what they pay.

Long-term users—those who've been with the service for months or years—tend to be particularly positive, which suggests that the platform maintains consistency over time rather than just putting on a good show for new customers.

One common theme across reviews: Proxys.io is recommended for people who value stability and support over rock-bottom pricing. If you need proxies that work and a team that responds when things don't, this appears to be a reasonable bet.
